## S3 Bucket ##

cStore will copy the configuration file into a specified AWS S3 Bucket.

To authenticate with AWS, use one of the [AWS methods](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/sdk-for-go/v1/developer-guide/configuring-sdk.html).

### Versioning Configuration ###

When pushing version of the configuration file, multiple files will be created in S3 allowing different versions to be updated or managed independently.

### Encryption ###

With the initial configuration push to S3, encryption settings are saved. To change these settings, re-push configuration with new encryption settings.

## Set Up Infrastructure ##

![AWS Architecture Example](cstore.png "AWS Architecture Example")

### Add ###
Add terraform S3 Bucket and KMS Key files to the project's infrastructure.
- [bucket.tf](../infrastructure/s3/bucket.tf)
- [kms.tf](../infrastructure/s3/kms.tf)
- [terraform.tfvars](../infrastructure/s3/terraform.tfvars)
- [variables.tf](../infrastructure/s3/variables.tf)
- [output.tf](../infrastructure/s3/output.tf) (optional)

### Configure ###
Update [terraform.tfvars](../infrastructure/s3/terraform.tfvars) to desired configuration.

Replace `{{CONTEXT}}` with the project name and cStore will correctly auto-default the bucket option for the first file's initial push.
```yml
bucket_name = "cstore-{{CONTEXT}}"
```
Add users to provide access to the bucket. IMPORTANT: Email addresses are case sensitive and roles must exist or the bucket will not be accessible or modifiable.

```yml
role_users = [
"{{USER_ROLE}}/{{EMAIL_ADDRESS}}", # use role name, not arn
]
```

Add task roles to provide access to the bucket for running tasks.
```yml
roles = [
"{{CONTAINER_ROLE}}", # use role name, not arn
]
```

Add iam users to provide access to the bucket for external service authenticating with secret access key.
```yml
users = [
"{{IAM_USER}}", # iam name, not arn
]
```

### Create ###
Authenticate and run terraform commands to spin up the S3 Bucket and KMS Key.

```bash
$ terraform init
$ terraform apply 
```

The S3 Bucket store is now set up and ready to be used. cStore prompts for an S3 bucket name when pushing any file for the first time.
