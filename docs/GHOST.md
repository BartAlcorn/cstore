## Ghost Files ##

Ghost files, named `.cstore`, are created in the directories of remotely stored files. These files make it possible to run cStore commands from the local directory of remotely stored files without being in the same directory as the  `cstore.yml`  catalog file.

These files are not critical and can be saved or discarded.
